# Amazon_Homepage_Clone
This repository contains the code for developing a replica of the Amazon home page using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to practice and showcase front-end web development skills.

HTML files: These files define the structure of the web page, including the header, navigation bar, search bar, product listings, and footer. The HTML code is organized using semantic elements and proper indentation for readability.

CSS files: These files contain the styles and layouts for the HTML elements. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to define colors, fonts, margins, padding, and other visual properties of the elements. The CSS code is structured using classes and IDs to target specific elements and apply the appropriate styles.

Images: The repository includes the necessary image files, such as the Amazon logo, product images, and background images, which are referenced in the HTML and CSS files.

Responsive Design: The code is optimized for responsive web design, ensuring that the page layout adapts well to desktop screen size only.
